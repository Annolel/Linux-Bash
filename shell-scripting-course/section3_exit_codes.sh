# Exercise 1:
# Write a shell script that displays "This script will exit with a 0 exit status." Be sure that the script does indeed exit with a 0 exit status.
echo "This script will exit with a 0 exit status."
exit 0

# Exercise 2:
# Write a shell script that accepts a file or directory name as an argument. 
# Have the script report if it is a regular file, a directory, or other type of file. If it is a regular file, exit with a 0 exit status. 
# If it is a directory, exit with a 1 exit status. If it is some other type of file, exit with a 2 exit status.

# Exercise 3:
# Write a script that executes the command "cat /etc/shadow". 
# If the command returns a 0 exit status report "Command succeeded" and exit with a 0 exit status. 
# If the command returns a nonÂ­zero exit status report "Command failed" and exit with a 1 exit status.
